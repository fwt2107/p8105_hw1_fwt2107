Problem 1
=========

We will create a dataframe with 4 entries for problem 1. We initialize the 4 entries first.

random\_sample is a vector of 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution \[0, 5\].

logic\_vector is a vector showing which numbers in random\_sample are greater than 2.

char\_vector is a character vector of length 10.

factor\_vector is a factor of length 10.

``` r
random_sample <- runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
logic_vector <- 2 > random_sample
char_vector <- vector(mode = "character", length = 10)
factor_vector <- factor(c(vector(length = 10)))
```

prob1\_dataframe is created containing the 4 vectors

``` r
library(tibble)
prob1_dataframe <- data_frame(
  random_sample,
  logic_vector,
  char_vector,
  factor_vector
)
```

The mean can be calculate for random\_sample and logic\_vector because their values are either numeric or logical

``` r
mean(prob1_dataframe$random_sample)
```

    ## [1] 2.545509

``` r
mean(prob1_dataframe$logic_vector)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

However, the mean cannot be calculated for char\_vector and factor\_vector because their values are not numeric nor logical

``` r
mean(prob1_dataframe$char_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(prob1_dataframe$char_vector): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(prob1_dataframe$factor_vector)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(prob1_dataframe$factor_vector): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA
